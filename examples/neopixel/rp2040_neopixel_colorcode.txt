On an RP2040 Zero with a NeoPixel, the color code for basic colors would be: 
    red (255, 0, 0), 
    green (0, 255, 0), 
    blue (0, 0, 255), 
    
where each value within the parentheses represents the intensity of red, green, and blue respectively, with a range from 0 (off) to 255 (full brightness). 

Key points about NeoPixel color codes:
    RGB format: NeoPixels use the RGB color model, meaning each color is defined by its red, green, and blue components. 
    Value range: Each color value can range from 0 to 255. 

Example color combinations:
White: (255, 255, 255) 
Purple: (255, 0, 255) 
Yellow: (255, 255, 0)
